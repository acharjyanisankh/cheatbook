# cheatbook
Original works at http://cheat.sh/

This is just a fork to this and works with debian ( based ) only ( e.g . Ubuntu , kubuntu etc )

script is as simple as anyone can understand and code use:

*git clone https://github.com/acharjyanisankh/cheatbook.git*

*cd cheatbook*

*sudo chmod +x install.sh*

*sudo ./install.sh*

Than Run the command in yor terminal #cheats --help

Have fun !!!
